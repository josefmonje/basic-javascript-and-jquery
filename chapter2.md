# Declarations

In JS, variables are dynamic, meaning they can be of any type. The keyword used to declare a variable determines the variable's availability.

```
var x
let a
const b
```
> *variable declarations*

`Var` used to be the only way to declare variables. There are now several ways.

`Let` allows a variable to "live" within a certain block of code instead of globally

`Const` is used for read-only values or constants

* **Must begin** with a letter, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`)
* Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs
* Numbers are **not** allowed as the first character
* **camelCase** is the preferred naming convention
* Can declare multiple variables in a line
* Value assignments not required on declaration
* Can accept default value after `||` ("or" operator) if value does not evaluate as true
